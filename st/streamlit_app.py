        Happiness is a rich and complex concept -- shaped by both how we feel and the conditions we live in.
        From economic stability and healthcare to personal freedom and community support, 
        many factors come together to define what it means to live a fulfilling life.

    This interactive app invites you to explore the **multifaceted nature of happiness** across the globe.
    Using data from the **World Happiness Index**, the **OECD Better Life Index**, **Gallup** and **Ilostat**. you'll dive 
    into both **subjective experiences** (how people report their well-being) and **objective indicators** (such as income, 
    health, and education).

    #### Discover for yourself:
    - What factors most strongly correlate with happiness?
    - How do countries differ in life satisfaction and living standards?
    - Which elements of well-being are most impactful?

    Whether you're curious about global trends, social research, or simply what makes people happy -- this tool is designed 
    to help you **explore, compare,** and **uncover insights** in a visual and engaging way.

    üëâ Get started by selecting a page from the sidebar to begin your exploration.
