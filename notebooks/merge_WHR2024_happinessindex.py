This script merges the scraped and cleaned data: ./data/clean/world_happiness_report_2024_clean.csv
with the "average life evaluation scores" for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 from
./data/clean/happinessindex.xlsx.

The data from the World Happiness Report 2024 includes the "Average Life Evaluation" and corresponding globally ranking
averaged over the annual Life Evaluation score of the preceding years 2024, 2023, 2022.
There is data available to download from: https://worldhappiness.report/data-sharing/ which includes the
three-year averages for life evaluation from 2012 onwards. This Excel-File was downloaded and saved as happinessindex.xlsx.

conclusion: all entries match -> we have all 147 countries in df_happiness matching the countries in df_WHR2024.
The "Average life Evaluation" value in df_WHR2024 matches with the "Ladder Score" of the year 2024 in df_happiness.
Since the "Average Life Evaluation" value is based on the annual value of the  preceded 3 years (2024-> 2024,2023,2022),
we merge the "Ladder scores" from the Years 2023,2022,2021,2020 from the happinessindex with our main dataset df_WHR24
