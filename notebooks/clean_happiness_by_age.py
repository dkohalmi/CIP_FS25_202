# read raw data, making sure pandas treats different "N/A" as missing values

# check column names:
df_raw_happiness_by_age.columns

# information about missing values and data type of the columns

# checking the 3 object columns
# check column "Country"

## Cleaning
# no further cleaning needed
# deep copy of the original dataframe to preserve the raw data

# select numerical columns and get a summary statistics

# loop through the columns and print the statistics
